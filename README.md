### üí° Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Identifying specific design properties (like font, color, padding, spacing) in Figma is **crucial for frontend consistency** and developer collaboration. It ensures that:

- Developers can **match the design exactly**
- There‚Äôs **visual consistency** across pages and components
- UI is more **scalable and maintainable**
- Speeds up the dev process by **removing guesswork**
- UX remains clean and professional on all screen sizes

A clear understanding of design specs ensures that what‚Äôs **designed is what gets built**.
